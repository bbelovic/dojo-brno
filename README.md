# Coding Dojo Brno

This repository is the home of the source code produced during the [Coding Dojo
Brno](https://dojo-brno.github.io) sessions.

The code here should be considered simply as a log of our activities.

## Guide

We've put together some [notes on how we often prepare and run our coding
dojos](DOJO.md). Far from complete, and possibly inaccurate at times, but may
serve as an overview guide if you find yourself in a dojo and don't know what to
do.
