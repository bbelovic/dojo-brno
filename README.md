# Coding Dojo Brno

This repository is the home of the source code produced during the Coding Dojo
Brno sessions.

The code has no value in itself, and it should be considered simply as a log of
our activities.


## Mailing List

We discuss before and after sessions via a [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dojo-brno).


## Guide

We've put together some [notes on how we often prepare and run our coding
dojos](DOJO.md). Far from complete, and possibly inaccurate at times, but may
serve as an overview guide if you find yourself in a dojo and don't know what to
do.
