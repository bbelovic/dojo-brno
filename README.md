# Coding Dojo Brno

This repository is the home of the source code produced during the Coding Dojo
Brno sessions.

The code has no value in itself, and it should be considered simply as a log of
our activities.


## Mailing List

We discuss before and after sessions via a [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dojo-brno).
